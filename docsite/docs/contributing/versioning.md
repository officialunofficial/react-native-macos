# Versioning

React Native macOS uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to control its versioning. Our minor releases are synced to upstream releases of React Native, but our patch versions may differ. For instance, `react-native-macos@0.78.5` corresponds to `react-native@0.78.2`. You can find out how we sync our releases by looking at our packages' [react-native peer dependency](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/blob/8f8fd013d2a36cf2635dbcef76970119f7672b51/packages/react-native/package.json#L105).

## How to push a new patch release

If you have a PR you'd like to be included in a new release, you can add a [Changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) to it.

```shell
yarn change
```
